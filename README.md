# Welcome to HackLLP I

## Motivation

This year, we've decided to introduce the first Data-Science Hackathon for LLP121 - Principles of Data-Science at Loughborough University London.

## What's a Hackathon?

When you start in a field such as data science, a theoretically endless field thats always advancing and ever changing, pinpointing a milestone where you can confidently say _I have enough knowledge_ can be challenging. In most technical and scientific fields, there's no clear midpoint where you can say _enough_. The sad truth is, its impossible. Mastering everything is simply unfeasable, so how do you know when you're capable enough and can finally start applying for jobs, doing your own research or just simply being a nerd?

One fun and guaranteed way of putting both your current knowledge and gaining new skills at the same time is by doing a **Data-Science Hackathon**. In tech, hackathons are known to be a great change to apply your current knowledge, meet people of similar interests, help solve some real-life problems, and in most cases, win decent financial prizes and get free food. Who doesn't like free food?

> Hackathons are sprint-like events that enable participants to define and try to solve problems in a _limited time period_.

This year, as a data-science practitioner enrolled in LLP121 - Principles of Data-Science, you have the chance to get involved in a unique opportunity to put your learnt skills to the test, collaborate, and simply have a good time.

## Instructions

As a group, choose **one** out of three proposed datasets. Once choosen, move onto [Task 1](#task-1). Once completed, move onto [Task 2](#task-2). 

### Tasks

#### Task 1

As a group, prepare a 5-min presentation. The presentation should include the following:
- Data-cleaning procedure (*optional*)
- An Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA) on your dataset of choice.
- Data visualisations

#### Task 2

As a group, apply suitable ML algorithms to your dataset of choice. Prepare a 5-min presentation showcasing your results. The presentation should include the following:

- Define the problem (What are you doing with the data?)
- Describe the choosen suitable ML algorithms for your problem, how you applied them.
- Showcase the effectiveness of the algorithm through measurements types learnt.

**Note**: You can define more than one problem to solve, apply multiple algorithms, and more. Your imagination is your only limitation
